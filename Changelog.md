# Changelog

### 0.13.0 (2025-12-15)

Added support for Python 3.14 and removed support for [PyPy](https://pypy.org/)
3.10.

`get_json_schema()` no longer reports all `scrapy.Item` fields as required.

### 0.12.2 (2025-09-02)

The return value of `get_json_schema()` is now deterministic (deterministic
order of dict keys and list items).

### 0.12.1 (2025-08-08)

`get_json_schema()` now supports inherited field docstrings.

### 0.12.0 (2025-07-24)

Added support for [PyPy](https://pypy.org/) 3.11
([#97](https://github.com/scrapy/itemadapter/pull/97)).

Added a new `get_json_schema()` class method to `ItemAdapter` and all built-in
adapters to output a [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/) for a given item
class ([#101](https://github.com/scrapy/itemadapter/pull/101)).

Modernized the code base, now making full use of
[pyproject.toml](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/writing-pyproject-toml/)
and using [ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/)
([#96](https://github.com/scrapy/itemadapter/pull/96),
[#98](https://github.com/scrapy/itemadapter/pull/98)).

([#93](https://github.com/scrapy/itemadapter/pull/93)).

Added support for Pydantic 2
([#91](https://github.com/scrapy/itemadapter/pull/91)).

Added `__all__` to the top-level module to improve type checks
([#90](https://github.com/scrapy/itemadapter/pull/90)).

Improved `pre-commit` and CI configuration
([#91](https://github.com/scrapy/itemadapter/pull/91),
[#92](https://github.com/scrapy/itemadapter/pull/92)).

### 0.10.0 (2024-11-29)

Dropped Python 3.8 support, added official Python 3.13 and PyPy 3.10 support
([#79](https://github.com/scrapy/itemadapter/pull/79),
[#87](https://github.com/scrapy/itemadapter/pull/87)).

Fixed the typing check when run with Scrapy 2.12.0+
([#88](https://github.com/scrapy/itemadapter/pull/88)).

Fixed `MANIFEST.in` that was missing some files
([#84](https://github.com/scrapy/itemadapter/pull/84)).

Enabled `pre-commit`
([#85](https://github.com/scrapy/itemadapter/pull/85)).

### 0.9.0 (2024-05-07)

Dropped Python 3.7 support, added official Python 3.12 support
([#75](https://github.com/scrapy/itemadapter/pull/75),
[#77](https://github.com/scrapy/itemadapter/pull/77)).

Updated the documentation and the type hint about `ItemAdapter.ADAPTER_CLASSES`
to say that subclasses can use any iterable, not just `collections.deque`
([#74](https://github.com/scrapy/itemadapter/pull/74)).

Documented that `Pydantic >= 2` is not supported yet
([#73](https://github.com/scrapy/itemadapter/pull/73)).

Updated CI configuration
([#77](https://github.com/scrapy/itemadapter/pull/77),
[#80](https://github.com/scrapy/itemadapter/pull/80)).


### 0.8.0 (2023-03-30)

([#65](https://github.com/scrapy/itemadapter/pull/65),
[#66](https://github.com/scrapy/itemadapter/pull/66),
[#69](https://github.com/scrapy/itemadapter/pull/69)).

It is now possible to declare custom `ItemAdapter` subclasses with their own
`ADAPTER_CLASSES` attribute, allowing to support different item types in
different parts of the same code base
([#68](https://github.com/scrapy/itemadapter/pull/68)).

Improved type hint support
([#67](https://github.com/scrapy/itemadapter/pull/67)).


### 0.7.0 (2022-08-02)

ItemAdapter.get_field_names_from_class
([#64](https://github.com/scrapy/itemadapter/pull/64))

Slight performance improvement
([#62](https://github.com/scrapy/itemadapter/pull/62))


### 0.5.0 (2022-03-18)

Improve performance by removing imports inside functions
([#60](https://github.com/scrapy/itemadapter/pull/60))


### 0.4.0 (2021-08-26)

Added `ItemAdapter.is_item_class` and `ItemAdapter.get_field_meta_from_class`
([#54](https://github.com/scrapy/itemadapter/pull/54))


### 0.3.0 (2021-07-15)

Added built-in support for `pydantic` models ([#53](https://github.com/scrapy/itemadapter/pull/53))


### 0.2.0 (2020-11-06)

Adapter interface: added the ability to support arbitrary types,
by implementing a MutableMapping-based interface.
By way of this change, now any type can be used as a Scrapy item.


### 0.1.1 (2020-09-28)

Dropped support for Python 3.5 (#38).

The new `get_field_meta_from_class` function offers the same functionality as
`ItemAdapter.get_field_meta` but for an item class, as opposed to an item
object (#34, #35).

`ItemAdapter.__repr__` no longer raises exceptions caused by the underlying
item (#31, #41).

Minor improvement to the release process (#37), and cleanup of test warnings (#40).


### 0.1.0 (2020-06-10)

Added `ItemAdapter.asdict`, which allows converting an item and all of its
nested items into `dict` objects (#27, #29).

Improved `ItemAdapter` performance by reducing time complexity for lookups and
traversals for dataclass and attrs items (#28).


### 0.0.8 (2020-05-22)

`ItemAdapter.field_names` now returns a `KeysView` instead of a `list`.

Minor CI and test changes.


### 0.0.7 (2020-05-22)

`ItemAdapter.get_field_meta` now returns an empty `MappingProxyType` object for
items without metadata support, instead of raising `TypeError`.

Improved the README and some docstrings.

Provided full test coverage, and refactored CI configuration, test
configuration and tests themselves.


### 0.0.6 (2020-05-09)

Added support for Scrapy’s `BaseItem`.

Refactored and extended tests.

Code style and documentation fixes.


### 0.0.5 (2020-04-28)

Removed support for `MutableMapping`.


### 0.0.4 (2020-04-28)

Removed metadata support for arbitrary mutable mappings.


### 0.0.3 (2020-04-27)

Rebuild for the Python Package Index.


### 0.0.2 (2020-04-27)

Split the implementation into several files for better code organization, and
without an impact on the existing API import paths.

Also improved the README.


### 0.0.1 (2020-04-25)

Initial release.
